This is not an official python ProtonMail API client. it allows you to read, send and delete messages in protonmail, as well as render a ready-made template with embedded images.

> [!NOTE]
> Congratulations, no need more to execute OpenPGP.js via playwright ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Installation
``` 
pip install protonmail-api-client
```

# Getting Started
### Get PGP private key and passphrase
Go to the [Email encryption keys](https://account.proton.me/u/0/mail/encryption-keys#addresses) section, click on "Export private key" (NOT the Account keys), create the passphrase.
(by the way, your private key must be primary in order to send messages)

> [!WARNING]
> Messages can only be decrypted using the private key that was primary at the time the messages was received.  
> for example, if you had one private key and then created another, then old messages can only be decrypted using the old private key, and new messages can only be decrypted with a new private key, if you delete the old private key, you will not be able to decrypt your old messages in any way (including in the web interface)

# Using
```py
from protonmail import ProtonMail

username = "YouAddress@proton.me"
password = "YourPassword123"

proton = ProtonMail()
proton.login(username, password)

private_key = 'privatekey.YourAddress@proton.me-123...89.asc'
passphrase = 'YourPassphrase'
proton.pgp_import(private_key, passphrase=passphrase)

# Get a list of all messages
messages = proton.get_messages()

# Read the latest message
message = proton.read_message(messages[0])
print(message.sender.address)  # sender address
print(message.subject)  # subject
print(message.body)
# <html><body><div>it's my image: <img src="cid:1234@proton.me">....

# Render the template, images downloading, converting to BASE64 and insert into html
proton.render(message)
# This is a ready-made html page, with all the pictures, you can save it right away
with open('message.html', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(message.body)
print(message.body)
# <html><body><div>it's my image: <img src="data:image/png;base64, iVBORw0K..">....

# Download file from message
first_file = message.attachments[0]
proton.download_files([first_file])
with open(f'{first_file.name}', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(first_file.content)

# Send message
recipients = ["to@gmail.com", "to2@gmail.com"]  # You canâ€™t send to @proton.me/@protonmail.com yet
subject = "My first message"
body = "<html><body>hello, i sent my first mail!</body></html>"  # html or just text

new_message = proton.create_message(
    recipients=recipients,
    subject=subject,
    body=body
)

sent_message = proton.send_message(new_message)

# Wait for new message
new_message = proton.wait_for_new_message(interval=1, timeout=60, rise_timeout=False, read_message=True)
if 'spam' in new_message.body:
    # Delete spam
    proton.delete_messages([new_message])

# Save session, you do not have to re-enter your login, password, pgp key, passphrase
# WARNING: the file contains sensitive data, do not share it with anyone,
# otherwise someone will gain access to your mail.
proton.save_session('session.pickle')

# Load session
proton = ProtonMail()
proton.load_session('session.pickle', auto_save=True)
# Autosave is needed to save tokens if they are updated
# (the access token is only valid for 24 hours and will be updated automatically)

# Getting a list of all sessions in which you are authorized
proton.get_all_sessions()

# Revoke all sessions except the current one
proton.revoke_all_sessions()
```

### event polling
Event polling. Polling ends in 3 cases:
1. Callback returns not `None`.
2. The callback raises the `SystemExit` exception.
3. Timeout ends.

For example, wait indefinitely until 2 messages arrive.
```python
def callback(response: dict, new_messages: list):
    messages = response.get('Messages', [])
    new_messages.extend(messages)
    if len(new_messages) >= 2:
        raise SystemExit

new_messages = []
proton.event_polling(callback, new_messages)
print(new_messages)
```
